# importations
The code used for the chapter of my PhD thesis.
All run in Python and NumPyro.

Scenario 1 -- two singular importation events (spikes):
* Thesis_double_spike_with_saving_results.ipynb -- runs the simulations, fits the model and saves the results
* Double_spike_analyse_results.ipynb -- loads the results and analyses the results (posterior predictive, errors)
* Double_spike_analyse_results_posterior_only.ipynb -- loads the results and analyses the results (posteriors of parameters)

Scenario 2 -- seasonal importation events:
*  Thesis_seasonal_with_saving_results.ipynb -- runs the simulations, fits the model and saves the results
*  Seasonal_analyse_results.ipynb -- loads the results and analyses the results (posterior predictive, errors)
